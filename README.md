# Repetier for the TronXY X1 Melzi board

Since TronXY hasn't yet released their source code for the X1 Melzi board, I attempted to build the current Repetier 0.92.9 and source all the necessary settings. Most of them are copied from the X3, which is in a way very similar.


## Config

All necessary configs for the X1 were made in the `Configuration.h` file.
I'm still experimenting


## Compiling

Use https://platformio.org to compile.
